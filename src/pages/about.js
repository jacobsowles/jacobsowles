            <img src={valueImage} alt="happy users" />

            <div>
              <h2>Value-driven</h2>

              <p>
                I continually ask myself, "Is what I'm doing adding value?".
                It's easy to get bogged down optimizing code into oblivion, but
                ultimately, we're building the software for a reason: to provide
                value to the users. Great code that ships is better than perfect
                code that doesn't. And code that ships should have concrete
                benefits for the users.

              <h2>Ego-free</h2>

              <p>
                I lead when my skill set aligns with the task at hand, and I
                seek out (and learn from) others when I recognize that Iâ€™m
                deficient in a particular area. Pretending to understand
                something, or exaggerating the extent to which one understands
                something, is damaging and expensive.

              <p>
                The world is bigger than the company I work for. I strive to

                I regularly evaluate what I know, what I don't know, what I'm
                doing that's working, and what I'm doing that's not. This
                critical analysis of myself and my systems prevents me from
                getting stuck in one pattern of thinking and acting in a way
                that may no longer be ideal. I often look to others (peers,
                authors, friends) to expose myself to new ideas.
